## Critical rules the agent must follow before doing anything
- Read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` before acting.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes.

## Testing and contribution
- Always write unit tests and check that they pass for new business logic.
- Always run unit tests to verify changes.
- Test both positive and negative scenarios.
- Do not rename files without a valid technical reason.

## Explicit prohibitions what agents must NOT do
- Do not bump major versions of core dependencies without a dedicated PR and discussion.

## Python Best Practices

## JavaScript Best Practices
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
